    <b>âš¡ Worldâ€™s Fastest Vector Database for AI & RAG</b>
</p>

# Casper

**Casper** is a high-performance Vector Search Database, perfectly suited for high-load search systems and AI applications (RAG). It provides a robust and scalable solution to store, search, and manage vectors efficiently.

Casper is built using Rust ðŸ¦€ for performance and reliability.

---

## Why Casper ?

**Casper** is the fastest vector database in our internal benchmarks. It consistently outperforms Qdrant across Top@K workloads and both f32 and i8 quantizations. Notably, Qdrant is widely recognized as the leading openâ€‘source engine and demonstrates stateâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘art throughput versus other databases (e.g., Weaviate, Milvus), as shown in their published results: [Qdrant benchmarks](https://qdrant.tech/benchmarks/). Surpassing Qdrant therefore places Casper ahead of the current openâ€‘source performance leader.

In practice, Casper delivers up to an orderâ€‘ofâ€‘magnitude higher RPS compared to Qdrant on our datasets, which translates directly into substantial infrastructure savings: fewer CPU cores and instances to achieve the same SLA, lower memory pressure, and reduced total cost of ownership due to more efficient use of compute resources. **Casper** is the ideal solution for high-load systems, real-time search, and AI & RAG.

**Conclusion**: Casper achieves performance unattainable for other databases under comparable conditions, requires fewer compute resources at the same load, and materially reduces infrastructure costs through more efficient CPU and memory utilization.

### Casper vs Qdrant

#### Benchmark

**Hardware:**

## HNSW

Casper features a highly efficient **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)** index, providing fast and accurate similarity search. 

### Metrics

Casper supports multiple distance metrics:

- **Euclidean**
- **Cosine**
- **Inner-Product**

### Quantizations

Quantizations: f32 (full precision), i8 scalar quantization (compressed). Reduces memory footprint and improves search performance.

- **f32**
- **i8**
